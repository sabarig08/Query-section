          Why is the moon sometimes out during the day? &CirclePlus;
        </summary>
        <hr />
        <p>
          The Earth's daily revolution on its axis means that the Moon is
          actually above the horizon for about 12 hours out of every 24.
          Usually, some portion of that time will be during daylight - you just
          need to look carefully, because its brightness is so much less than
          the Sun's.

        <summary>Why is the sky blue? &CirclePlus;</summary>
        <p>
          Sunlight reaches Earth's atmosphere and is scattered in all directions
          by all the gases and particles in the air. Blue light is scattered
          more than the other colors because it travels as shorter, smaller
          waves. This is why we see a blue sky most of the time.

        <summary>Will we ever discover aliens? &CirclePlus;</summary>
        <p>
          Although no extraterrestrial life has been found and life may still be
          just a rarity from Earth, there are scientific reasons to suspect that
          it can exist elsewhere, and technological advances that may detect it
          if it does. Many scientists are optimistic about the chances of
          finding alien life.

        <summary>How do airplanes stay up? &CirclePlus;</summary>
        <p>
          Airplane wings are shaped to make air move faster over the top of the
          wing. When air moves faster, the pressure of the air decreases. So the
          pressure on the top of the wing is less than the pressure on the
          bottom of the wing. The difference in pressure creates a force on the
          wing that lifts the wing up into the air.
